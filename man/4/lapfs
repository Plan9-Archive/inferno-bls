.SH NAME
lapfs \- laptop file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lapfs
[
.B -d
]
.I cache
[
.I server
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lapfs
acts as a mirroring file system targetted for use in laptop computers.
When the machine running
.I lapfs
is connected to its file server, copies of all data exchanged between server
and client are stored on the client's local disk.
When the client is not on the server's network, then all requests are
served out of that local store, and
.I lapfs
acts as a write-back cache.
Reads are processed normally.
Writes are both sent to the local store and are recorded in a
file for later playback.
When
.I lapfs
connects to a file server, if there is a file of recorded operations,
they are sent to the file server before it falls into normal
operation.

.I Lapfs
listens on TCP port 1962 for connections from clients.
When a client closes the connection,
.I lapfs
exits.

The optional
.B -d
argument turns on verbose output for debugging.
.I Lapfs
always requires that it's cache/mirror location be specified.
If the server is also given and if
.I lapfs
is able to successfully connect to the server, then
.I lapfs
will use its connected, mirroring behavior.
If either no server is specified, or if
.I lapfs
is unable to connect to the server, then
it will go into its cache-only behavior.
Both
.I cache
and
.I server
can take one one of three formats.
If the string begins with
.L /chan
then it is taken to be the pathname to a channel which
is then opened and used directly.
If the string contains an exclamation point (!)
then it is taken to be a network address that is dialed,
and the resulting data fd is used to communicate with
the server.
Finally, if the string begins with an octothorp (#)
or a slash (/)
then it is taken to be the path to a directory where the
cache or server files are to be found.
In this case,
.I lapfs
creates a pipe and calls
.IR sys-export (2)
with one end of the pipe and the string as arguments.

When
.I lapfs
is operating in a cache-only mode, it records all write
requests in the file
.L wblog
in the directory from which 
.I lapfs
is run.
However, if the file does not exist when
.I lapfs
is started, it does not create the file.
When the log file is played back on a successful connection
to the file server, it is truncated and begins accumulting
more changes to relay to the server.

.SH EXAMPLES

Serving a local cache and mounting it on
/n/fs:
.IP
.EX
lapfs /usr/inferno/lib/fscache
mount -A 'tcp!127.1!1962' /n/fs
.EE
.PP
Mouting the
.I lapfs
service with P9P connecting to a server named bootes (serving an
unauthenticated connection on port 6666) with the
cache stored on the host system:
.IP
.EX
lapfs '#U*/home/foo/.bootescache' 'tcp!bootes!6666'
.EX
.PP
and on the host system:
.IP
.EX
9 mount 'tcp!127.1!1962' /home/foo/fs
.EE
.PP

.SH BUGS

does not directly support authentication.
